# DaVinci

## Overview

DaVinci is a powerful and flexible library for Authentication and Authorization. It is designed to be easy to use and
extensible. It provides a simple API for navigating the authentication flow and handling the various states that can
occur during the authentication process.

## Add dependency to your project

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation(project(":davinci"))
}
```

## Usage

To use the `DaVinci` class, you need to create an instance of it and pass a configuration block to the constructor. The
configuration block allows you to customize various aspects of the `DaVinci` instance, such as the timeout and logging.

Here's an example of how to create a `DaVinci` instance:

```kotlin
val daVinci = DaVinci {
    // Oidc as module
    module(Oidc) {
        clientId = "test"
        discoveryEndpoint = "https://auth.pingone.ca/" +
                "02fb4743-189a-4bc7-9d6c-a919edfe6447/as/.well-known/openid-configuration"
        redirectUri = "org.forgerock.demo://oauth2redirect"
        scopes = mutableSetOf("openid", "email", "address", "profile", "phone")
    }
}
var node = daVinci.start()
node = node.next()
```

The `DaVinci` depends on `oidc` module. It discovers the OIDC endpoints with `discoveryEndpoint` attribute.

The `start` method returns a `Node` instance. The `Node` class represents the current state of the application. You can
use the `next` method to transition to the next state.

### More DaVinci Configuration

```kotlin
val daVinci = DaVinci {
    timeout = 30 //Default 30s, Seconds for network timeout
    logger = Logcat //Default Logcat, this is the default, you can override the logger to log information
    module(Oidc) {
        //...
        storage = MemoryStorage<Token>() //Default DataStoreStorage, you can override the storage to store the tokens
    }
}
```

### Navigate the authentication Flow

```kotlin
val node = daVinci.start() //Start the flow

//Determine the Node Type
when (node) {
    is Connector -> {}
    is Error -> {}
    is Failure -> {}
    is Success -> {}
}
```

| Node Type | Description                                                                                               |
|-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Connector | In the middle of the flow, call ```node.next``` to move to next Node in the flow                          |
| Error     | Unexpected Error, e.g Network, parsing ```node.cause``` to retrieve the cause of the error                |
| Failure   | Bad Request from the server, e.g Invalid Password, OTP, username ```node.message``` for the error message |
| Success   | Authentication successful ```node.session``` to retrieve the session                                      |

### Provide Input

For `Connector` Node, you can access list of Collector with `node.collectors()` and provide input to
the `Collector`.
Currently, there are, `TextCollector`, `PasswordCollector`, `SubmitCollector`, `FlowCollector`, but more will be added in the future, such as `Fido`,
`SocialLoginCollector`, etc...

To access the collectors, you can use the following code:

```kotlin
    node.collectors.forEach {
        when(it) {
            is TextCollector -> it.value = "My First Name"
            is PasswordCollector -> it.value = "My Password"
            is SubmitCollector -> it.value = "click me"
            is FlowCollector -> it.value = "Forgot Password"
        }
    }

    //Move to next Node, and repeat the flow until it reaches `Success` or `Error` Node
    val next = node.next()
```

### Error Handling

For `Error` Node, you can retrieve the cause of the error by using `node.cause()`. The `cause` is a `Throwable` object,
when receiving an error, you cannot continue the Flow, you may want to display a generic message to user, and report
the issue to the Support team.
The Error may include Network issue, parsing issue, API Error (Server response other that 2xx and 400) and other unexpected issues.

For `Failure` Node, you can retrieve the error message by using `node.message()`, and the raw json response with `node.input`. 
The `message` is a `String` object, when receiving a failure, you can continue the Flow with previous `Connector` Node, but you may want to display the error message to the user.
e.g "Username/Password is incorrect", "OTP is invalid", etc...

```kotlin
val node = daVinci.start() //Start the flow

//Determine the Node Type
when (node) {
    is Connector -> {}
    is Error -> {
        node.cause() //Retrieve the cause of the error
    }
    is Failure -> {
        node.message() //Retrieve the error message
    }
    is Success -> {}
}
```

### Node Identifier

You can use the `node.id()` to identify the current state of the flow. The `id` is a unique identifier for each node.

For example, you can use the `id` to determine if the current state is `Forgot Passowrd`, `Registration`, etc....

```kotlin

when (node.id()) {
    "cq77vwelou" -> "Sign On"
    "qwnvng32z3" -> "Password Reset"
    "4dth5sn269" -> "Create Your Profile"
    "qojn9nsdxh" -> "Verification Code"
    "fkekf3oi8e" -> "Enter New Password"
    else -> {
        ""
    }
}
```

Other than `id`, you can also use `node.name` to retrieve the name of the Node, `node.description` to retrieve the description of the Node.

### Work with Jetpack Composable

ViewModel
```kotlin
//Define State that listen by the View
var state = MutableStateFlow<Node>(Empty)

//Start the DaVinci flow
val next = daVinci.start()

//Update the state
state.update {
    next
}

fun next(node: Connector) {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        val next = node.next()
        state.update {
            next
        }
    }
}
```

View
```kotlin
when (val node = state.node) {
    is Connector -> {}
    is Error -> {}
    is Failure -> {}
    is Success -> {}
}
```

### Post Authentication
After authenticate with DaVinci, the user session will be stored in the storage.
To retrieve the existing session, you can use the following code:

```kotlin
//Retrieve the existing user, if ST cookie exists in the storage, ```user``` will be not null.
//However, even with the user object, you may not be able to retrieve a valid token, as the token and refresh may be expired.

val user: User? = daVinci.user()

user?.let {
    it.accessToken()
    it.revoke()
    it.userinfo()
    it.logout()
}


```
